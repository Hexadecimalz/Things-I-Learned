# Things-I-Learned
Notes for projects major or minor where I learned something and wanted to record it to reference in the future. 

## ðŸª€Philosophy 
One of the reasons why wikis are so boring, and people don't want to document projects, is because there is no personal value to most documentation wikis. You might think: "I did it once, I could do it again, and why would someone else do my job?" They forget the extra effort they spent in the Mines of Google shoveling away to find that diamond ðŸ’Ž of knowledge buried inside many pages of docs, to find the one thing, the one way it works for their special case.

The idea behind this repo is to document some of the interesting bits (or at least to me), maybe it won't be the most entertaining work of non-fiction, but hopefully it would be more meaningful as it's personally valuable to me. 

Should you find something here that is useful to you, please let me know. Share what you know!
